Flashcards are a great tool when you want to memorize a new topic or learn a new language. You write a question on the front of the card and the answer on the back of the card. Then you can test your memory by going through the flashcards. The more often you show a card to yourself, the better your chances of memorizing its content. With Django, you can build your own flashcards app.

By following this tutorial, you’ll build a Django flashcards app that replicates a spaced repetition system, which can boost your learning potential.
